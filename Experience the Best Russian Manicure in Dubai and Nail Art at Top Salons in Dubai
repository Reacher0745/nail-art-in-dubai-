What is a Russian Manicure?
A Russian manicure, also known as a dry manicure, is a meticulous nail care technique that focuses on precise cuticle work and perfect nail shaping. Unlike traditional manicures, it does not involve soaking the nails in water. Instead, electric nail drills are used to gently remove excess cuticle and dead skin, resulting in a clean and polished look. This technique not only enhances the appearance of your nails but also promotes healthier nail growth. For the Best Russian Manicure In Dubai   Code Hair's expertise is unmatched.
